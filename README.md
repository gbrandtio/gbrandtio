### Hello :earth_asia:
- âš¡Trying to become an individual contributor on [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and learn more about Blockchain and Web3.
- :book: Usually I'm blogging about Software Engineering stuff on [Medium](https://ioannis-brandt.medium.com/).
- :desktop_computer: Supporting the community on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6392398/ioannis-brant-ioannidis) and [Code Review](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/268896/ioannis-brant-ioannidis).
- ðŸ”­ Currently working on code refactoring, design patterns implementation and real problem analogies, and appliance of best practices. [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) is a huge inspiration.
- :page_with_curl: In my free time I'm learning Flutter, which is one of the most exciting frameworks for mobile applications I've worked with. Also, I'm working on some small side projects and would be extremely happy if anyone wants to collaborate :grin:.
