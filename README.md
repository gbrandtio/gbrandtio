### Hi there :earth_asia:
I'm [Ioannis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ioannis-brandt/), a passionate Software Engineer from Greece. I've earned my BSc in Computer Science from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and almost completed the MSc Interactive Hardware and Software Technologies on the same university - dropped out on the final semester when I relocated in Dubai, UAE.

Lately, I'm very passionate about writing clean and maintainable code (maybe too passionate some times :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:) and a huge fan of [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin). Planning to clean up the codebases in my repositories during 2023 - any assistance on it would be greatly appreciated.

### 2023
- âš¡Trying to become an individual contributor on [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and learn more about Blockchain and Web3.
- :book: Usually I'm blogging about Software Engineering stuff on [Medium](https://ioannis-brandt.medium.com/).
- :desktop_computer: Supporting the community on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6392398/ioannis-brant-ioannidis) and [Code Review](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/268896/ioannis-brant-ioannidis).
- ðŸ”­ Currently working on code refactoring, design patterns implementation and real problem analogies, and appliance of best practices.
- :page_with_curl: In my free time I'm learning Flutter, which is one of the most exciting frameworks for mobile applications I've worked with. Also, I'm working on some small side projects and would be extremely happy if anyone wants to collaborate :grin:.
